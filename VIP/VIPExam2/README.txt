math
ast

BeautifulSoup (4.2.0)

Python Imaging Library (PIL)

=======================================================

HOW TO RUN:
-------------------------------------------------------
Run main.py, as it is currently placed, from terminal
without any arguments, i.e. python main.py .

You will then be prompted with 3 different choice:
1. Create database
2. Retrieve an image
3. Quit

The package already comes with a .html database,
but it requires the specific folder path of:
../VIPExam2/101_ObjectCategories/category/any_image.jpg
This means option 2 can be run out of the box.

With a different folder path choose option 1, but be
warned that the runtime is quite long (approx. 2hours).
